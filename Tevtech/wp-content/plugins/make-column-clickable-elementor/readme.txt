== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How this plugin Works? =

This plugin will add a custom URL field in each column of your Elementor editor. If you fill it, the column will be clickable.

Please note that the plugin works using JavaScript. So it's not an actual
&lt;a&gt; element. I do recommend you to also add the regular links on your inner elements for SEO and compatibility purposes. So you make sure that columns and default elements are workingl.
