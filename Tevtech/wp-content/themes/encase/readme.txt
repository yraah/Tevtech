    Recommended Plugins - Optional
-------------------------------------------------------

To get your site looking like the live demo website, this theme uses several
plugins to help make the enhancements to give your website an 
amazing showcase style.

- Jetpack
- Breadcrumbs NavXT
- Hide Title
- Remove Widget Titles
- Simply Exclude
- Widget CSS Classes
- WP Google Maps
- Font Awesome Shortcodes
- Widgetkit

Please note that if you do not use or plan to use Jetpack, I've noted
a couple plugins to use, otherwise Jetpack already has those built-in.
